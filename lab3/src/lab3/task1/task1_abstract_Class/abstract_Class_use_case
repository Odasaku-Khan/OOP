Use an abstract class when:

You want to share code (fields or methods) among related classes.
The class represents a base from which other classes will inherit, and there is a "is-a" relationship (e.g., Animal -> Dog, Cat).
You want to enforce that some methods must be implemented by subclasses while providing common behavior for others.
